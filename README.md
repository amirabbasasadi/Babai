- [to do] Constrained Optimization Problems
### Gradient free solvers
#### Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization
The APSO solver was implemented based on this paper:
- Zhan, Z. H., Zhang, J., Li, Y., & Chung, H. S. H. (2009). Adaptive particle swarm optimization. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics), 39(6), 1362-1381.  
Parameters Adaption and Elistic Learning are implemented.
